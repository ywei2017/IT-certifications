# IT-certifications
# Why this?
 Aren't there enough things about IT certifications, or education in general?
* Yes, there is plenty of resources of taking any IT certifications.
  * There is **possibly more to be done on education though**. 
* And overall, I have not been that big a fan of certifications - I was too busy doing the work. There
  are two things the swayed my thoughts:
  1. One of my colleagues said *"a certificate is proof of some sort, otherwise how would anybody know 
     you did all the stuff?"*
  2. Most importantly, I often "take a crash course on something" to know enough to solve the problem at hand,
     and often wish I could invest more time to know more. *The certification process can serve that purpose*.

**It is decidedly the last bulletpoint** that drove the action.

## But why a git repo?
As I work on the certifictions (CKA as of April 2022), I take notes, and etc, and need to organize them. 
* I could take it all privately at my home system.
* Or in a public place, and hopefully somebody might find something useful. In the worst case, not harmful.
* I can do a blog, but that is too much work (and so much last decade).

# What it is, or is not?
* Each page will be about a specific certification
* It answers the question if somebody asks, "hey, can you tell me more about that certifications?"
* There are NO practice questions, or study guide. There are many good resources and online courses.
